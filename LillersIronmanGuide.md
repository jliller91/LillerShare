# Liller's Ironman Guide
[Here is the official Wiki starter guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/New_player_guide)
### TL:DR 
- Brain dumped info as the last section if you want to skip to that. Do quests when you can and feel like questing, play how you want by picking the fun skills, ignore the "Efficiency Scape" guides cause they'll burn you out quick, THE WIKI IS YOUR FRIEND. Go kill chickens, bury bones, collect their feathers for Flyfishing. Cut logs and use tinder box to cook chickens. This will level a lot of diff skills and gve you a feel for how skills overlap. The flow of the game is every 5 to 10 levels you unlock new equipment, training methods that make your character train quicker, do more damage, survive better etc. The biggest pillars of progression IMO are Skill level, Gear acquired, Travel methods aqcuired. 

- Please ask me any questions you want, Ive wanted to yap about this game for YEARS

## Settings and Setup:

### RuneLite
- Plugins to get or enable
    - Menu Entry Swapper - Lets you swap around what you're left click defaults to for everything, Huge QOL for certain activities
    -
    - Almost every activity (minigame like thing for XP and rewards, Tempeross the fishing boss for example) has specific plugins you can download to make things easier to track. Just search plugins for whatever you're doing
    

### OSRS Settings
- Enable Shift to Drop
- Enable Split Private Chat
- Turn off Rooftops
- Collection Log Notification ( I need to double check this one)
- Equip Gear when looting Gravestones

## Stuff to do
- Quests
    - Quests are fairly unique in OSRS and not like stuff you find in WoW, GW2 etc. They are fleshed out with a story and have multiple steps rather than just "get me 10 boar livers". A lot of the starter and f2p quests are rather short but once you get into Member's quests they can be 3-5 hour longs but have incredible rewards.
    - Getting quests done early is nice because they almost always have an XP reward. So the sooner you get it the more useful that XP is. 
    - Late game quests are usually blocked by having done earlier quests so getting early ones done is helpful
- Level Skills
    - Your methods of training early is limited (especially in F2P) but try not to focus on being maximumally efficient and focus on having fun and doing what you want. Just pick one of the skills you want to level and 
- Minigames
    - The only minigame Im aware of for F2P is Castle Wars, I loved this when I used to play originally but havent since. It's a PVP team vs team game. Could be fun to do as a group :D
## Free to Play Goals
- Complete Stronghold of Security (Get good boots and 10,000 GP)
- Dragon Slayer - This is the final F2P Quest and most difficult. Pretty much all of the other quests you do and skills you train lead up to killing a dragon. It's a classic and it's a good goal to shoot for. If you make it here and decide you like the game enough this is a great time to go P2P

## P2P Goals
 - Recipe for Disaster Quest for Barrows Glove (best in slot melee, range, mage glove FOR A LONG TIME)
- I'll write up more detailed if ya'll end up getting a subscription (you totally should) :) 
	
## General Info
- Click the WIKI banner at the bottom right of your Minimap and click an item/NPC to quick open the wiki. VERY USEFUL PLEASE USE
- Ironman means you cannot trade other players or use the Grand Exhange (Auction house in Varrock). 
- If another account tags the same mob as you in multicombat, you'll no longer be eligible loot. People who do this on purpose they refer to as "ragging", trying to ruin your experience so you world hop. 
- There are some specific changes to the game that are specifically for Ironman but it's VERY rare
    - I know a cluescroll step is blocked for Ironman because it was too difficult to do without buying the items for them at the GE
    - Ironman can create private instances in some places to fight bosses without having normal accounts rag them
- Death mechanics have changed many times over the years but I think the current version is....if you die there is a gravestone you. You have an hour to get back to it and grab your stuff. After that the grim reaper holds your stuff and you have to pay to get it back. Some instanced stuff, like certain quest bosses" are considered "unsafe". Unsafe meaning if you drop something in the instance and leave, that thing is GONE. If you die in the instance you might have to pay a set amount of GP (I think its 80k) to get your stuff back.
- There's an ingame thing called "Adventure Path" that is supposed to help new players. That's newer so Im not sure how it works but could be worth checking out.
- Combat Triangle and Attack Styles
    - Melee beats Ranged, Ranged beats Mage, Mage beats Melee
    - Attack styles with melee weapons will level Attack, Strength, or Defense
        - Mage and Ranged can level up Defense by using the last attack style.
        - For Range use RAPID attack style and a short box. Everything else is worse (unless this changed in the last year and I missed the patch notes)
    - All combat styles will level your HP
    - Enemies will be weak to certain types of melee styles (Crush, Stab, Slash), Weak to a certain ranged ammo (this is a newer addition and Im not too familiar with it), and also weak to specific elements potentially (this is newer as well so Idk much other then using the wiki to see what spell to use)
- Equipment
    - Generally upgrade every 10 levels but you can check your in game guide (Right click a skill and hit guide. This will let you know what level you can equip or train something)
    - Generally will have to buy or get as a drop. Making your own gear doesnt happen to often until later in the game in P2P
    - Melee
        Bronze -> Iron -> Steel -> Black -> Mithril -> Adamantite -> Rune -> Dragon (members only)
    - Ranged
        - Leather armor -> Green Dragonhide (only f2p dragon hide)
    - Mage 
        - Blue Wizard Robes + Hat (im not sure if you can get any upgrades)
- Shift Left clicking things offer A LOT of options with RuneLite. This is how you use the Menu Entry Swapper and also highlight Tiles/NPCs/Monsters
- You can click the orb on your minimap that looks like a boot to toggle running/walker. You have a set amount of run energy (Agility, memmbers skill, makes this better) CTRL + Click to Run or Walk, which is opposite of your currently selected.
- The Prayer Orb near the Run orb works similarly. You can right click and have a preset prayer. Then clicking it will toggle that on and off
